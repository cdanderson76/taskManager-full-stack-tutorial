CHALLENGE: Start Frontend 2

NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE '.ENV' FILE BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Install React Icons and import the following icons into the 'List' component:  

   BiEditAlt
   BsTrash

   Use the following boilerplate code for the 'List' component:

   <li>
      <div className="icon_holder"></div>
   </li>


2. Ensure that each list item has a discernable color.  In the 'index.css' file, create the
   hover 'pointer' effect for the icons, so that they show the pointer when hovered over.
   
   Page should look like Anki and the icons should have the appropriate hover effect added.
