CHALLENGE: Building Our API

NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE '.ENV' FILE BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!

We will create new tasks with this lesson.

1. Set up your schema.  Do this by creating '/backend/models/taskModel.js.  Inside of 
   'taskModel.js' create a schema called 'taskSchema', and create an object for the name
    of the task.  It should be a string, and it should be required.  Include something
    that keeps track of the time the tasks were made as well.


2. Go into 'server.js' and create the middleware so that you are able to parse incoming
   requests with JSON payloads.  Also, change the app method to a 'POST' method, and create
   the async function that creates the task.  If there is no name, have it throw a 400 error
   stating that a 'name' has to be provided.

   Use the '/api/tasks' endpoint to create a task.

3. Write the code within the function to create the task.  If it's successful, return status
   201, if it isn't, return status 500.  Wrap this in a try/catch, and test this route out
   in Postman by creating a task.

   If you get the 201 confirmation, check MongoDB, and you should see the information there.
