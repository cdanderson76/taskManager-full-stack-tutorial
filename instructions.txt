CHALLENGE: Start Frontend

NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE '.ENV' FILE BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Delete 'blah.txt', as it was only there to hold the 'frontend' folder in place. Navigate 
   into the 'frontend' directory and create a Vite app within that same directory.

2. Delete the following files:
 
   App.css
   assets
   README.md

   Delete all boilerplate code and imports that don't exist any longer.  Ensure you are able
   to render something to the page with no styles added.

3. Copy and paste the CSS styles from the CSS.txt file within the repo.  Create
   '/src/components/List.jsx' and use the text 'LIST' to render its location.  Use the 
   following for 'App.jsx' boilerplate code:

   <main>
      <h1 className="title">CRUD Operations</h1>
      <form onSubmit={''} className="input_holder">
        <input type="text" />
        <button>Add Task</button>
      </form>
      <ul>
        <List/>
      </ul>
    </main>
   
   
   You should now see what's in Anki.
