CHALLENGE: Consolidate Routes

NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE '.ENV' FILE BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Consolidate all of the routes by creating '/backend/routes/taskRoute.js'.  Import Express 
   Router, ensure that you export it, and then copy/paste the routes from 'server.js' into 
   'taskRoute.js'.


2. Create the base route in 'server.js', and get rid of the imports that you are no longer
   using. Import a custom named variable called 'taskRoutes' from '/routes/taskRoute.js'.
   Back in '/routes/taskRoute.js', remove the complete URL and only use the endpoints.
   With this change, you would now have to import 'Mongoose' and the 'Task' model.


3. Create '/backend/controllers/taskController.js' and within the file, you are going to
   copy/paste all of the async functions from 'taskRoute.js' and into 'taskController.js.  
   The name of the functions will be as follows:

   getTasks
   createTask
   editTask
   deleteTask


4. Check the routes again and ensure all are working
