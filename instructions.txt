CHALLENGE: Control the Input

NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE '.ENV' FILE BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Inside of 'App.jsx' create state for the input field so that we are able to use controlled
   elements.  You can test by console logging your input as the typing is done.

2. Once you have controlled the input, set up a function that will submit the data typed in
   for now, just ensure that you log this to the console.  Output should be similar to what
   you see in Anki.
