CHALLENGE: Update UI and Delete

NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE '.ENV' FILE BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Create some state for updating the UI, and initalize it to 'false'.  Use this in the
   dependency array of the 'useEffect' hook, and also pass it to the 'List' component.


2. As of now, you can only see new items if the page is refreshed.  Update the 'addTask'
   function to render an item as soon as it is entered.


3. Create a function in the 'List' component that will remove a task from the page/database.
   Ensure that you can see the instant and updated UI after an item has been deleted.
