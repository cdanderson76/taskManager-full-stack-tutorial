CHALLENGE: Update a Task

NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE '.ENV' FILE BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Create an async function that will update a task.  Return a server error of 500 (Server Error) in the
   'try/catch', but do create a conditional statement prior to the 'try/catch' that validates the MongoDB
   ID.  If the ID doesn't match, use error 404 ('Invalid task ID').

2. Test out editing a task within Postman.  If it updates successfully, you have completed this challenge.
