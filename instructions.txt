CHALLENGE: Get All Tasks

NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE '.ENV' FILE BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!

We will now write code to retrieve all tasks


1. Inside of 'server.js', create an async function that will grab all tasks from the database.  
   Write out a 'try/catch' statement that gives an error of 500 ('Server Error').

2. Create a test in Postman and test this route.  You've completed the challenge if you were 
   able to do so.
