CHALLENGE: Delete Task

NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THE '.ENV' FILE BEFORE STARTING THIS CHALLENGE!

We will now write code to delete a task


1. Inside of 'server.js', create an async function that will delete a task.  Ensure you use
   the ':id' endpoint to help detect the specific task that needs deletion.  If the deletion
   is successful, return status 200 with a message.

2. The only error that can really occur in this scenario is that the product may not be there
   or it hasn't even been created.  Return status 400 with a message of product not found in
   this instance.

3. Create a test in Postman, and delete an 'already-created' task in MongoDB by using its
   ID provided by the database.  You've completed the challenge if you were able to do so.
